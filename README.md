Letâ€™s build a simple mobile application which will extensively use the server side tags and functionalities in coldfusion.
This will be a dummy bank application in which we can add transactions, list all the saved transactions, generate PDF report of all transactions, convert them into a spreadsheet and sent the reports as part of an email.
All this looks highly impossible in plain Javascript code but with ColdFusion we can implement all these functionalities in much quicker and simplified manner.

This app would have given you an idea of how we can leverage server side functionalities while building Mobile apps in coldfusion. We need not to write separate front end, separate back end and then integrate both the ends with the help of API calls. You just need to write your front as well as server side logic in the same file. Coldfusion will take care of separating the layers and invoking API calls on your behalf and getting server side code executed at the coldfusion server which you would have specified.
